Description: This project was the final project for my postgraduate network science class. It involved data analysis and modeling of the comprehensive mathematical network, encompassing theorems, definitions, axioms, corollaries, and more. The primary objective was to create educational roadmaps from fundamental nodes to other knowledge nodes, aiding in the understanding and navigation of mathematical concepts. We utilized advanced graph theory algorithms and linear algebra techniques to achieve this goal.;
